# Turning Excel File Into A Web App With Python.

Demo: https://enosh-s-excel-webapp-app-bm5sgq.streamlitapp.com/

In this project, I am trying to convert Excel Files into a dynamic Web Application by using the Python Library called Streamlit. The beauty of Streamlit is that you can create web applications directly in Python, without needing to know HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. The Web App is fully interactive and will be updated, whenever you make changes in the Excel file.
